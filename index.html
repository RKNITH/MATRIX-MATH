            <h2>History of Matrices</h2>
            <p>Matrices, rectangular arrays of numbers or functions, are fundamental in various fields of mathematics
                and science. The development of matrix theory spans several centuries and has been instrumental in the
                advancement of linear algebra.</p>

            <h3>Timeline of Key Developments</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>2nd Century BC:</strong> The earliest known use of matrix-like arrangements can be traced
                    back to ancient China. In the text "The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art," methods for solving
                    systems of linear equations are presented, which implicitly involve matrices.</li>

                <li><strong>1693:</strong> The term "matrix" (Latin for "womb" or "mother") was first used by the
                    mathematician James Joseph Sylvester. However, matrices in their modern form were not yet fully
                    developed.</li>

                <li><strong>1850:</strong> Arthur Cayley published "A Memoir on the Theory of Matrices," which is
                    considered one of the foundational works in matrix theory. Cayley introduced the concept of matrix
                    multiplication and the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.</li>

                <li><strong>Late 19th Century:</strong> Mathematicians such as Ferdinand Frobenius and Camille Jordan
                    further developed the theory of matrices. Frobenius contributed to the understanding of matrix
                    eigenvalues and eigenvectors, while Jordan introduced the Jordan normal form.</li>

                <li><strong>Early 20th Century:</strong> Matrices became essential in quantum mechanics, thanks to
                    physicists such as Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac. Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation of
                    quantum mechanics laid the groundwork for modern quantum theory.</li>

                <li><strong>1930s:</strong> John von Neumann and Alan Turing used matrices in the development of
                    computer science and numerical analysis. Von Neumann's work on the foundations of quantum mechanics
                    and Turing's work on algorithms and computation were heavily influenced by matrix theory.</li>

                <li><strong>Mid to Late 20th Century:</strong> The development of digital computers revolutionized the
                    use of matrices. Matrices became crucial in computer graphics, numerical simulations, and data
                    analysis.</li>

                <li><strong>21st Century:</strong> Matrices continue to play a vital role in various modern
                    applications, including machine learning, cryptography, and network theory. Advances in
                    computational power have enabled the use of large-scale matrices in big data and artificial
                    intelligence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Concepts and Applications</h3>

            <p>Matrices are used in many mathematical and practical applications, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solving Systems of Linear Equations:</strong> Matrices provide a concise way to represent
                    and solve systems of linear equations using methods such as Gaussian elimination.</li>
                <li><strong>Transformations in Geometry:</strong> Matrices are used to perform linear transformations,
                    such as rotations, translations, and scalings, in computer graphics and geometry.</li>
                <li><strong>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:</strong> These are essential in many areas, including
                    stability analysis, vibration analysis, and quantum mechanics.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Analysis and Statistics:</strong> Matrices are used in various statistical methods,
                    including principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Theory:</strong> Adjacency matrices represent graphs and networks, enabling the
                    analysis of their properties and behaviors.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Matrices are fundamental in representing data sets,
                    transformations, and operations in machine learning algorithms.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Understanding the history and development of matrices provides insight into their wide-ranging
                applications and their importance in modern science and technology.</p>

        <section id="transpose">
            <h2>Transpose of a Matrix</h2>
            <p>The transpose of a matrix is an operation that flips the matrix over its diagonal. This means that the
                rows of the original matrix become the columns in the transposed matrix, and the columns become the
                rows.</p>

            <p>Mathematically, the transpose of a matrix A is denoted by A<sup>T</sup>. If matrix A is an m x n matrix,
                then the transpose of A, denoted A<sup>T</sup>, is an n x m matrix.</p>

            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p>Consider the following matrix A:</p>
            <pre>
        A = [1 2 3]
            [4 5 6]
            </pre>

            <p>The transpose of matrix A, denoted as A<sup>T</sup>, is:</p>
            <pre>
        A<sup>T</sup> = [1 4]
                  [2 5]
                  [3 6]
            </pre>

            <h3>Properties of the Transpose:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(A<sup>T</sup>)<sup>T</sup> = A:</strong> The transpose of the transpose of a matrix is the
                    original matrix.</li>
                <li><strong>(A + B)<sup>T</sup> = A<sup>T</sup> + B<sup>T</sup>:</strong> The transpose of a sum of two
                    matrices is the sum of their transposes.</li>
                <li><strong>(kA)<sup>T</sup> = kA<sup>T</sup>:</strong> The transpose of a scalar multiple of a matrix
                    is the scalar multiple of the transpose of the matrix.</li>
                <li><strong>(AB)<sup>T</sup> = B<sup>T</sup>A<sup>T</sup>:</strong> The transpose of a product of two
                    matrices is the product of their transposes in reverse order.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Applications of Transpose:</h3>
            <p>The transpose operation is used in various applications such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Algebra:</strong> Transpose is used to define symmetric and skew-symmetric matrices,
                    and to find the orthogonal complement of a matrix.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Graphics:</strong> Transpose is used in transformations and to represent rotations
                    in 3D space.</li>
                <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Transpose is used in covariance matrices and in the representation of
                    data sets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Determinant of a Matrix</h2>
            <p>The determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. It is a
                useful value in linear algebra and has many applications in areas such as systems of linear equations,
                geometry, and calculus.</p>

            <h3>Theory:</h3>
            <p>The determinant of a 2x2 matrix:</p>
            <pre>
        A = [a b]
            [c d]
            
        det(A) = ad - bc

            <p>The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:</p>
            <pre>
        A = [a b c]
            [d e f]
            [g h i]
            
        det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)
            </pre>

            <p>For larger matrices, the determinant can be calculated using a method called expansion by minors or using
                row reduction techniques.</p>

            <h3>Properties of Determinants:</h3>
            <ul>

            <h2>Inverse of a Matrix</h2>
            <p>The inverse of a matrix is a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in the identity
                matrix. The identity matrix is a square matrix with 1's on the diagonal and 0's elsewhere.</p>

            <h3>Theory:</h3>
            <p>For a square matrix ( A ), its inverse ( A<sup>-1</sup></sup>) satisfies the equation:</p>
            <pre>
        A * A<sup>-1</sup> = I
            </pre>
            <p>where ( I) is the identity matrix of the same dimension as ( A).</p>

            <h3>Conditions for Inversibility:</h3>
            <p>A matrix ( A ) is invertible (also called non-singular) if and only if its determinant is non-zero. If
                the determinant of ( A ) is zero, then ( A ) does not have an inverse and is called a singular
                matrix.</p>

            <h3>Calculating the Inverse:</h3>
            <p>For a 2x2 matrix:</p>
            <pre>
        A = [a b]
            [c d]
        
        A<sup>-1</sup> = (1 / (ad - bc)) * [ d -b]
                                           [-c  a]
            </pre>
            <p>For larger matrices, the inverse can be calculated using methods such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gaussian Elimination:</strong> Transforming the matrix into its row echelon form and
                    performing row operations to obtain the identity matrix.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjoint Method:</strong> Using the matrix of cofactors (adjugate matrix) and dividing by the
                    determinant.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Properties of the Inverse:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>(A<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> = A:</strong> The inverse of the inverse of a matrix is the
                    original matrix.</li>
                <li><strong>(AB)<sup>-1</sup> = B<sup>-1</sup>A<sup>-1</sup>:</strong> The inverse of a product of two
                    matrices is the product of their inverses in reverse order.</li>
                <li><strong>(A<sup>T</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> = (A<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>T</sup>:</strong> The inverse of the
                    transpose of a matrix is the transpose of the inverse of the matrix.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Applications of the Inverse:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solving Systems of Linear Equations:</strong> The inverse of a matrix can be used to solve
                    linear systems of the form ( AX = B ) by computing ( X = A<sup>-1</sup>B).</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Graphics:</strong> Inverse matrices are used in transformations and to undo
                    operations such as rotations and scaling.</li>

            <h2>Cramer's Rule</h2>
            <p>Cramer's Rule is a mathematical theorem used to solve systems of linear equations with an equal number of
                equations and unknowns, using determinants. It provides an explicit formula for the solution of the
                system in terms of the determinants of the coefficient matrix and matrices formed by replacing columns
                of the coefficient matrix.</p>

            <h3>Theory:</h3>
            <p>Consider a system of linear equations represented in matrix form as:</p>
            <pre>
        AX = B
            </pre>
            <p>where <em>A</em> is the coefficient matrix, <em>X</em> is the column vector of unknowns, and <em>B</em>
                is the column vector of constants. Cramer’s Rule states that if the determinant of matrix <em>A</em>
                (denoted as <em>det(A)</em>) is non-zero, the solution for each variable <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> in
                vector <em>X</em> can be found using:</p>
            <pre>
        x<sub>i</sub> = frac{det(A<sub>i</sub>)}{det(A)}
            </pre>
            <p>where <em>A<sub>i</sub></em> is the matrix obtained by replacing the <em>i</em>-th column of <em>A</em>
                with the vector <em>B</em>.</p>

            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p>Consider the following system of equations:</p>
            <pre>
        2x + 3y = 8
        4x + 5y = 18
            </pre>
            <p>This can be written in matrix form:</p>
            <pre>
        A = [2 3]
            [4 5]
        
        X = [x]
            [y]
        
        B = [8]
            [18]
            </pre>

            <p>First, calculate the determinant of <em>A</em>:</p>
            <pre>
        det(A) = (2 * 5) - (3 * 4) = 10 - 12 = -2
            </pre>

            <p>Next, find <em>A<sub>1</sub></em> by replacing the first column of <em>A</em> with <em>B</em>:</p>
            <pre>
        A<sub>1</sub> = [8 3]
                     [18 5]
        
        det(A<sub>1</sub>) = (8 * 5) - (3 * 18) = 40 - 54 = -14
            </pre>

            <p>Now, find <em>A<sub>2</sub></em> by replacing the second column of <em>A</em> with <em>B</em>:</p>
            <pre>
        A<sub>2</sub> = [2 8]
                     [4 18]
        
        det(A<sub>2</sub>) = (2 * 18) - (8 * 4) = 36 - 32 = 4
            </pre>

            <p>Finally, calculate <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>:</p>
            <pre>
        x = det(A<sub>1</sub>) / det(A) = -14 / -2 = 7
        y = det(A<sub>2</sub>) / det(A) = 4 / -2 = -2
            </pre>
            <p>Thus, the solution to the system of equations is:</p>
            <pre>
        x = 7, y = -2
            </pre>

            <h3>Properties of Cramer's Rule:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Applicable only for square matrices:</strong> Cramer’s Rule can only be used for systems of
                    equations where the number of equations equals the number of unknowns.</li>
                <li><strong>Requires non-zero determinant:</strong> The determinant of the coefficient matrix must be
                    non-zero for a unique solution to exist.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple computation:</strong> Cramer’s Rule can be computationally intensive for large
                    systems due to the need for multiple determinants.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Applications of Cramer's Rule:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solving Linear Systems:</strong> Cramer’s Rule is a straightforward method for finding the
                    solutions of small linear systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Theoretical Analysis:</strong> It is useful in theoretical contexts to demonstrate the
                    existence of solutions in linear algebra.</li>

        <section id="consistency">
            <h2>Consistency Test of Linear Equations</h2>
            <p>The consistency of a system of linear equations determines whether the system has at least one solution.
                A system can be classified as consistent or inconsistent based on the relationships among the equations.
            </p>

            <h3>Theory:</h3>
            <p>A system of linear equations is said to be consistent if it has at least one solution, while it is
                inconsistent if it has no solutions. There are three types of consistency for a system of linear
                equations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistent and Independent:</strong> The system has exactly one solution. This occurs when
                    the equations represent lines (or planes) that intersect at a single point.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent and Dependent:</strong> The system has infinitely many solutions. This occurs
                    when the equations represent the same line (or plane), leading to multiple intersection points.</li>
                <li><strong>Inconsistent:</strong> The system has no solutions. This occurs when the equations represent
                    parallel lines (or planes) that never intersect.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <p>Consider the following systems of equations:</p>

            <h4>1. Consistent and Independent:</h4>
            <pre>
        2x + 3y = 5
        4x - y = 1
            </pre>
            <p>This system has a unique solution. You can solve it using substitution or elimination methods.</p>

            <h4>2. Consistent and Dependent:</h4>
            <pre>
        x + 2y = 4
        2x + 4y = 8
            </pre>
            <p>Here, the second equation is a multiple of the first, indicating infinitely many solutions (the equations
                represent the same line).</p>

            <h4>3. Inconsistent:</h4>
            <pre>
        x + y = 2
        x + y = 5
            </pre>
            <p>In this case, the two equations represent parallel lines, which means there is no solution.</p>

            <h3>Consistency Tests:</h3>
            <p>To determine the consistency of a system of equations, you can use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Row Echelon Form:</strong> Transform the system into row echelon form (REF) or reduced row
                    echelon form (RREF). Analyze the resulting matrix:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there are any rows where all coefficients are zero and the constant is non-zero (e.g., 0 =
                        5), the system is inconsistent.</li>
                    <li>If there are no such rows, the system is consistent.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Determinants:</strong> For a square system (n equations, n unknowns), if the determinant of
                    the coefficient matrix is non-zero, the system is consistent and has a unique solution.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
